## Introduction

I am a software developer and consultant specializing in AI‑assisted Software Development. I help organizations integrate AI into products and engineering workflows to accelerate delivery, improve quality, and scale development practices from planning through production. My work focuses on human–AI collaboration, workflow automation, and data‑driven decisions that translate into measurable business value.

## Work experience

I have planned, architected, and delivered platforms end‑to‑end across B2B services, IoT, virtual events, and finance. Recent work includes multi‑region B2B APIs for device ecosystems and robotics, a virtual event platform used by 400+ listed companies, and high‑SLA investor relations tooling. I focus on practical AI adoption—augmenting product features and engineering workflows to shorten cycle time, improve reliability, and scale teams.
