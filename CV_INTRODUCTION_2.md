# Introduction

I am an experienced full-stack developer and consultant specializing in AI adoption and software modernization. I guide organizations through integrating AI-assisted development into their workflows, from training and enablement to architecting custom AI solutions that improve code quality, testing, and compliance automation.

With over a decade of experience building software across diverse sectors—B2B services, IoT systems, virtual event platforms, and financial applications—I have worked in both in-house and consultancy environments. I focus on delivering practical, scalable solutions from initial planning through to production deployment, leveraging AI-native approaches to create measurable value for teams and businesses.
