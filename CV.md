## Biography

I am an experienced full-stack developer and consultant with a focus on AI adoption and software modernization. Over the years, I have delivered solutions across a wide range of domains, including B2B and B2C services, IoT systems, payment service integrations, ticket vending machines, and financial applications and more.

With experience in both in-house and consultancy roles, I help organizations integrate AI-assisted development into their workflows — from team training and enablement to designing and implementing custom AI solutions that enhance code quality, testing, and automation. I focus on delivering practical, outcome-driven solutions from planning through to production deployment, applying AI-native approaches that create measurable value for teams and businesses.
