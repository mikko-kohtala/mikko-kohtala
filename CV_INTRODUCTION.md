# Introduction

I am a Technical AI Lead Consultant at Aimbition, where I guide organizations through practical AI adoption and software modernization. My work centers on helping teams integrate AI-assisted development into their workflows, from training and enablement to architecting custom AI solutions for code review, testing, and compliance automation.

With over a decade of full-stack development experience, I have built software across diverse sectors including B2B services, IoT systems, virtual event platforms, and financial applications. My technical foundation spans modern web technologies—TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Next.js—backed by cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I've worked in both in-house and consultancy environments, often joining projects from initial planning through to production deployment, ensuring solutions are practical, scalable, and user-focused.

Throughout my career, I have evolved from hands-on development to technical leadership, while maintaining a strong focus on AI-native approaches to software engineering. I leverage AI-assisted tools including Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot, and work extensively with LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to deliver modern, AI-enhanced solutions that create measurable value for teams and businesses.
